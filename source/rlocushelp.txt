Select the type of the system. If you press ON, it will now skip everything until the root locus plot. If not, it will tell you the coefficients of the numerator and denominator (for checking), the ceros and the poles." + 10 CHR + 10 CHR + "While drawing the plot, you can press ENTER to make it 10x faster, but it will lose quality. The percentage done is shown in the upper-left corner of the display. You can press ON to cancel the drawing. When drawn, the upper left corner shows the distance between two dots of the axis." + 10 CHR + 10 CHR + "When it is finished you can press ALPHA to add a PI/PD/PID regulator. If there is already one, it will ask you to remove it. An example of input format for numbers is '-12.3E-3'. While in the graphic screen press the arrows to change the value of k and see where are the poles for that value. Press SPC to set the value of k manually. Press ENTER to see the current poles for that value of k. Press BACKSPACE to hide the poles.
