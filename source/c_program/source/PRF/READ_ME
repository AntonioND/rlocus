DESCRIPTION:
This software is for determination of polynomial roots (in C) and for 
spectral factorization (in MATLAB).

The main C routine is null.c. The required subroutines are contained in
complex.c, muller.c, newton.c, and tools.c. The file rootsl.c is a 
MATLAB (version 4) gateway file. The file rootsl.mex4 is an executable
(on SUN workstations) mex file. To create a mex file for other machines 
use the 'makefile' (might require some modifications). Please note
that we use ANSI C. You may create a shell executable by the command 
'gcc -ansi test.c null.c muller.c complex.c tools.c newton.c -lm'.

The main (MATLAB) routine for spectral factorization is factorize.m.
