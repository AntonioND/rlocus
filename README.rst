Root Locus v0.3
===============

This program allows you to see the root locus of any given transfer function and
to add a regulator. You can quickly modify the value of ‘k’ and see if the
system with that gain would be stable or unstable. You can also see the
positions of the poles for that gain.

It has been created using HP-GCC 2.0, so it can only run on an hp 50g (and maybe
hp 49g+). It isn’t needed to install ARM ToolBox in your calculator, though, the
program comes in a way it will run without using it.

It has been hosted since 2012 here: https://www.hpcalc.org/details/7354

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This program was created with HP-GCC. That means that if it
crashes there is no way to return to the HP menu by software means. In case that
happens, just press the reset button (or remove a battery and put it back again
after a second).  This program has been tested a lot, it shouldn’t crash, but
better safe than sorry. You may even lose the contents of the non-flash memory
(ports HOME, 0 and 1). You should do backups of your files just in case.
